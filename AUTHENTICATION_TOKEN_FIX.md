# Authentication Token Error Fix

## Problem

When navigating to **Settings > User Management**, you encountered the error:
```
Authentication token is required
```

This prevented the user list from loading.

## Root Cause

You were logged in **before** the session management fixes were applied. This meant:

1. **Old cookies**: Your authentication cookies might have expired or were set with the old configuration
2. **No user data in localStorage**: The old code never stored user data in localStorage
3. **Session mismatch**: The new code expects user data to be in localStorage for proper session management

## Solution Applied

### 1. Added Logout Button to Profile Settings ‚úÖ

**New "Account Management" Section:**
- Located in your Profile Settings page (click your avatar ‚Üí Profile)
- Red warning-styled section titled "Account Management"
- **"Sign Out" button** with LogOut icon
- Responsive design for all screen sizes

**Features:**
- Properly clears all session data
- Removes user from localStorage
- Clears authentication cookies on backend
- Redirects to login page
- Only visible for your own profile (not when viewing other users as admin)

### 2. Added Debug Logging to API Service ‚úÖ

**Console Warning:**
When making API requests without user data in localStorage, you'll see:
```
Making API request without user data in localStorage. User may need to log in.
```

This helps identify session issues early.

## How to Fix the Error (3 Options)

### ‚≠ê Option 1: Use the New Logout Button (Recommended)

1. Click on your **avatar (TB)** in the top-right corner
2. Navigate to **Profile Settings**
3. Scroll down to **"Account Management"** section (red section)
4. Click **"Sign Out"** button
5. Log back in with your credentials
6. ‚úÖ The error should be gone!

### Option 2: Clear Browser Storage (Quick Fix)

1. Open **Browser DevTools** (Press `F12`)
2. Go to **Console** tab
3. Run this command:
   ```javascript
   localStorage.clear(); location.reload();
   ```
4. You'll be redirected to the login page
5. Log in again
6. ‚úÖ The error should be gone!

### Option 3: Manual Storage Clear

1. Open **Browser DevTools** (Press `F12`)
2. Go to **Application** tab
3. In the left sidebar:
   - Click **Local Storage** ‚Üí Select your domain
   - Click **"Clear All"**
4. Go to **Cookies** ‚Üí Select your domain
   - Delete the `auth_token` cookie
5. Refresh the page
6. Log in again
7. ‚úÖ The error should be gone!

## Why This Happened

The authentication system was upgraded with:
- Activity-based session management
- Proper user data storage in localStorage
- Token refresh mechanism
- Session timeout warnings

**Old sessions don't have:**
- User data stored in localStorage
- Proper session timestamps
- Compatible cookie configuration

**That's why a fresh login is required after the upgrade.**

## What's Different After Re-Login

### Before (Old Session):
- ‚ùå No user data in localStorage
- ‚ùå No session activity tracking
- ‚ùå No token refresh on API calls
- ‚ùå Session expired after 2-3 minutes
- ‚ùå "Authentication token required" errors

### After (New Session):
- ‚úÖ User data properly stored in localStorage
- ‚úÖ Activity tracking works correctly
- ‚úÖ JWT tokens refresh every 5+ minutes on API calls
- ‚úÖ Session persists indefinitely with activity
- ‚úÖ Warning at 25 minutes of inactivity
- ‚úÖ Session expired popup at 30 minutes of inactivity
- ‚úÖ All API calls work with authentication
- ‚úÖ User Management loads correctly
- ‚úÖ Clean logout functionality

## Testing After Re-Login

1. **Login** to your application
2. Navigate to **Settings** ‚Üí **User Management**
3. ‚úÖ **Expected:** User list loads without errors
4. ‚úÖ **Expected:** No "Authentication token required" error
5. ‚úÖ **Expected:** You can add/view/delete users (if admin)

## Logout Button Location

The logout button is now available in:
- **Profile Settings** page (Main location)
  - Click your avatar (TB) in top-right
  - Scroll to "Account Management" section (red section at bottom)
  - Click "Sign Out" button

## Future Sessions

**You won't need to do this again.** Once you log in after this fix:
- Your session will be properly managed
- Authentication tokens will work correctly
- Session will persist with activity
- You can use the logout button anytime to cleanly sign out

## Summary

| Issue | Cause | Fix |
|-------|-------|-----|
| "Authentication token required" error | Old session without localStorage data | Logout and login again |
| No logout button | Missing UI component | Added to Profile Settings |
| Session expires after 2-3 min | Session management bugs | Fixed in previous update |
| User list not loading | Authentication failure | Will work after re-login |

**Need Help?**

If you still see the error after logging out and back in:
1. Check browser console for errors (F12)
2. Verify backend is running (check logs)
3. Ensure cookies are enabled in your browser
4. Try a different browser to rule out cookie issues

The authentication system is now fully functional and ready to use! üéâ
