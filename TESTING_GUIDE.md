## Test 1: Protected Routes (Logout Redirect)

### Steps:
1. **Login** with any user credentials
2. **Logout** using the logout button
3. Try to access: `http://localhost:5173/dashboard`
4. Try to access: `http://localhost:5173/settings`

### Expected Result:
‚úÖ Both URLs should **immediately redirect** to `/login`

‚úÖ Accessing `/settings` URL should redirect to `/dashboard`

**Test as Admin:**
1. Logout and login with an **admin** account (role: "admin")
2. Check the left sidebar navigation
3. Click on Settings in the sidebar

### Expected Result:
‚úÖ Settings link **SHOULD appear** in sidebar
‚úÖ Clicking Settings opens the Settings page successfully

---

## Test 3: Admin Password Reset

### Steps:

**As Admin:**
1. Login as **admin**
2. Navigate to **Settings** page
3. You should see a list of users
4. Find a user (not yourself) in the table
5. You should see **three icons**:
   - üëÅÔ∏è Eye icon (View Profile)
   - üîë Blue Key icon (Reset Password) - **NEW!**
   - üóëÔ∏è Red Trash icon (Delete User)

6. Click the **Blue Key icon** for any user
7. A modal should appear: "Reset Password"
8. Click **"Generate"** button to generate a password
9. Click **"Reset Password"**

### Expected Result:
‚úÖ Blue key icon appears for all users except yourself
‚úÖ Modal opens with user's name
‚úÖ Generate button creates a random password
‚úÖ Success message appears: "Password reset successfully for [User Name]!"
‚úÖ Check backend logs - should show password reset action

**As Regular User:**
1. Logout and login as **regular user**
2. Settings page should not be accessible (redirects to dashboard)

### Expected Result:
‚úÖ Regular users cannot access Settings at all
‚úÖ Even if they try API directly, it will return 403 Forbidden

## Test 4: Session Management

### Steps:
1. Login successfully
2. Check browser console - should see:
   ```
   Session initialized with timestamp: [timestamp]
   Session start time set: [timestamp]
   ```
3. Use the application normally
4. Wait 5 minutes idle (or adjust `SESSION_TIMEOUT` for faster testing)

### Expected Result:
‚úÖ After 25 minutes idle: Session warning appears
‚úÖ After 30 minutes idle: Session expired dialog appears
‚úÖ After clicking "Log In Again": Redirects to login
‚úÖ User activity (clicks, scrolls) extends the session

## Test 5: Cookie Authentication

### Steps:
1. Login successfully
2. Open Browser DevTools ‚Üí Application ‚Üí Cookies
3. Check for cookie named: `auth_token`
4. Verify cookie properties:
   - HttpOnly: ‚úÖ Yes
   - Secure: Depends on environment (production only)
   - SameSite: Strict
   - Max-Age: 1800 (30 minutes)

### Expected Result:
‚úÖ Cookie exists and is httpOnly (can't be accessed by JavaScript)
‚úÖ API requests automatically include this cookie
‚úÖ Logout clears the cookie

---

## Test 6: User Data Fetching (Settings Page)

### Steps:
1. Login as **admin**
2. Navigate to **Settings** page
3. Check browser Network tab (DevTools)
4. Look for request: `GET /api/v1/users`

### Expected Result:
‚úÖ Request returns **200 OK** (not 401 Unauthorized)
‚úÖ Users list displays on the page
‚úÖ No console errors

---

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Still getting 401 errors on `/users` endpoint
**Solution**: 
1. Check if backend server restarted after installing cookie-parser
2. Check browser console for cookie presence
3. Try hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)

### Issue: Settings link shows for regular user
**Solution**:
1. Check user role in browser console: `localStorage.getItem('user')`
2. Should see role as "admin" or "user" (lowercase)
3. Clear localStorage and login again if role is wrong

### Issue: Session expires immediately
**Solution**:
1. Already fixed in AuthContext.jsx
2. Check browser console for "Session initialized" message
3. Should NOT see "Session expired" right after login

### Issue: Password reset button not visible
**Solution**:
1. Ensure you're logged in as admin
2. Ensure you're looking at OTHER users (not yourself)
3. Hard refresh the page

### Check user data in browser console:
```javascript
// Check stored user
JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('user'))
