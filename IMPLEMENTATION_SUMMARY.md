# Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented session management, profile features, responsive design, and skeleton loaders across the Email Dashboard application.

---

## ✅ 1. Activity-Based Session Management

### Backend Changes
**File: `email_dashboard-be/src/middlewares/auth.middleware.ts`**
- Added automatic JWT token refresh on every authenticated request
- Token refreshes if it's more than 5 minutes old
- Extends session automatically on user activity (API calls)
- Session expires only after 30 minutes of **inactivity**

**How it Works:**
1. User makes any API call (viewing data, navigating pages, etc.)
2. Backend checks token age
3. If token is > 5 minutes old, it generates a new token
4. New token is sent as an httpOnly cookie
5. This resets the 30-minute expiration timer

### Frontend Session Tracking
**File: `email_dashboard-fe/src/lib/sessionManager.js`**
- Tracks user activity (mouse movements, clicks, scrolling, keyboard)
- Updates last activity timestamp
- Shows warning 5 minutes before expiry
- Session expires only after 30 minutes of complete inactivity

### Result
✅ Users stay logged in as long as they're active
✅ Session only expires after 30 minutes of no activity
✅ No unnecessary logouts during active use

### Responsive Testing
1. Test on Chrome DevTools device emulator
2. Test on actual mobile device
3. Test tablet view (iPad)
4. Test different desktop resolutions
5. Test table scrolling on mobile

### Loading States Testing
