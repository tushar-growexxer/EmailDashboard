# Feature Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the implementation of three major features requested by the user:
1. Protected routes with automatic redirect to login
2. Admin-only Settings visibility
3. Admin password reset functionality

---

## Feature 1: Protected Routes & Auto-Redirect to Login

### Problem
Users could access protected pages like `/dashboard` and `/settings` even after logging out by directly typing the URL.

### Solution Implemented

#### Frontend Changes

1. **ProtectedRoute Component** (`email_dashboard-fe/src/components/ProtectedRoute.jsx`)
   - Already existed and working correctly
   - Checks `isAuthenticated` from `AuthContext`
   - Redirects to `/login` if not authenticated
   - Shows loading spinner while checking auth status

2. **AdminRoute Component** (`email_dashboard-fe/src/components/AdminRoute.jsx`) - **NEW**
   - Created new component for admin-only routes
   - Checks both authentication AND admin role
   - Redirects to `/login` if not authenticated
   - Redirects to `/dashboard` if not admin
   - Shows loading spinner while checking

3. **Updated App.jsx** (`email_dashboard-fe/src/App.jsx`)
   - Wrapped Settings route with `AdminRoute` component
   - Settings page now requires admin role at route level

```jsx
<Route path="/settings" element={
  <AdminRoute>
    <Settings />
  </AdminRoute>
} />
```

### Testing
- ✅ Logout and try accessing `/dashboard` → Redirects to `/login`
- ✅ Logout and try accessing `/settings` → Redirects to `/login`
- ✅ Login as regular user and try `/settings` → Redirects to `/dashboard`
- ✅ Login as admin and access `/settings` → Works correctly

## Feature 2: Hide Settings Navigation for Non-Admin Users

### Problem
Settings link was visible to all users in the sidebar navigation, even though non-admin users shouldn't access it.

### Solution Implemented

#### Frontend Changes

1. **Fixed DashboardLayout** (`email_dashboard-fe/src/components/layout/DashboardLayout.jsx`)
   - **ISSUE**: Was not passing `user` prop to `SidebarNew`
   - **FIX**: Added `useAuth()` hook and passed `user` prop
   
```jsx
const { user } = useAuth();
return <SidebarNew user={user} />
```

2. **Updated SidebarNew** (`email_dashboard-fe/src/components/layout/SidebarNew.jsx`)
   - **ISSUE**: Had hardcoded default user with role "Admin"
   - **FIX**: Removed default value, now uses actual logged-in user

```jsx
const SidebarNew = ({ user }) => {
  // Uses actual user prop instead of hardcoded default
```

3. **Fixed SidebarNavigation** (`email_dashboard-fe/src/components/layout/SidebarNavigation.jsx`)
   - **ISSUE**: Role check was case-sensitive ("Admin" vs "admin")
   - **FIX**: Made role check case-insensitive

```jsx
// Before: if (userRole === "Admin")
// After: if (userRole && userRole.toLowerCase() === "admin")
```

### Testing
- ✅ Login as admin → Settings link appears in sidebar
- ✅ Login as regular user → Settings link NOT in sidebar
- ✅ Role check is case-insensitive (works with "admin", "Admin", "ADMIN")

## Feature 3: Admin Password Reset for Other Users

### Problem
Admin users had no way to reset passwords for other users without knowing their current password.

### Solution Implemented

#### Backend Changes

1. **User Service** (`email_dashboard-be/src/services/user.service.ts`)
   - Added `resetUserPassword(userId, newPassword)` method
   - Does NOT require current password
   - Validates password strength (min 8 characters)
   - Hashes password before storing
   - Logs admin password reset action

2. **User Controller** (`email_dashboard-be/src/controllers/user.controller.ts`)
   - Added `ResetPasswordRequest` interface
   - Added `resetUserPassword` endpoint handler
   - Validates userId and password
   - Prevents admin from resetting their own password this way
   - Returns appropriate error messages

3. **User Routes** (`email_dashboard-be/src/routes/user.routes.ts`)
   - Added new route: `PATCH /api/v1/users/:id/reset-password`
   - Protected with `authenticateToken` and `requireAdmin` middleware
   - Only admins can access this endpoint

```typescript
router.patch('/:id/reset-password', userController.resetUserPassword.bind(userController));
```

#### Frontend Changes

1. **User API** (`email_dashboard-fe/src/api/user.js`)
   - Added `resetUserPassword(userId, newPassword)` method
   - Uses PATCH request to backend endpoint

2. **Settings Page** (`email_dashboard-fe/src/pages/Settings.jsx`)
   - Added password reset modal
   - Added password reset button (key icon) for each user
   - Added password generation for reset
   - Password validation (min 8 characters)
   - Success/error messaging
   - Prevents admin from resetting their own password

#### UI Components Added
- **Reset Password Button**: Blue key icon next to delete button
- **Reset Password Modal**: 
  - Shows user name
  - Password input field
  - Generate password button
  - Validation and error messages
  - Cancel and Reset buttons

### Security Features
- Admin cannot reset their own password (must use change password)
- Password must be at least 8 characters
- Password is hashed before storing
- Action is logged for audit trail
- Requires admin role at both route and middleware level

### Testing
- ✅ Admin can see password reset button for other users
- ✅ Admin cannot see reset button for themselves
- ✅ Password generation works
- ✅ Password validation (min 8 characters)
- ✅ Success message appears on successful reset
- ✅ Error messages show for failures
- ✅ Backend logs the action

## Files Modified

### Backend (`email_dashboard-be`)
1. `src/app.ts` - Added cookie-parser middleware
2. `src/services/user.service.ts` - Added resetUserPassword method
3. `src/controllers/user.controller.ts` - Added resetUserPassword endpoint
4. `src/routes/user.routes.ts` - Added reset-password route
5. `package.json` - Added cookie-parser dependencies

### Frontend (`email_dashboard-fe`)
1. `src/App.jsx` - Added AdminRoute for Settings
2. `src/components/AdminRoute.jsx` - **NEW** Admin-only route component
3. `src/components/layout/DashboardLayout.jsx` - Pass user to sidebar
4. `src/components/layout/SidebarNew.jsx` - Use actual user prop
5. `src/components/layout/SidebarNavigation.jsx` - Case-insensitive role check
6. `src/contexts/AuthContext.jsx` - Fixed session initialization
7. `src/api/user.js` - Added resetUserPassword method
8. `src/pages/Settings.jsx` - Added password reset UI

---

## Database Impact
- No schema changes required
- Uses existing user table
- Password updates use existing `U_Password` column
- `U_UpdatedAt` timestamp updated on password reset

---

## Security Considerations

### Authentication
- All protected routes require valid authentication
- Cookies are httpOnly (protected from XSS)
- Session timeout after 30 minutes of inactivity
- Automatic redirect to login on session expiry

### Authorization
- Settings page requires admin role at route level
- Settings API endpoints require admin role at middleware level
- Double-layer protection (frontend + backend)
- Admin cannot delete or reset password for themselves

### Password Security
- Passwords hashed with bcrypt (12 salt rounds)
- Minimum 8 character requirement
- Password reset logged for audit trail
- Old password not returned in any API response

---

## How to Deploy

### Backend
```bash
cd email_dashboard-be
pnpm install          # Install new dependencies (cookie-parser)
npx tsc               # Build TypeScript
pnpm start            # Start production server
# OR
pnpm dev              # Start development server
```

### Frontend
```bash
cd email_dashboard-fe
npm install           # Ensure all dependencies installed
npm run dev           # Start development server
# OR
npm run build         # Build for production
```

### Environment Variables
No new environment variables required. Existing `.env` setup works.

---

## Rollback Plan
If issues arise, revert these commits:
1. Cookie parser fix (CRITICAL - do not revert)
2. Session management fix (CRITICAL - do not revert)
3. Admin route protection (safe to revert)
4. Password reset feature (safe to revert)

To rollback just password reset feature:
```bash
git revert <commit-hash>  # Revert password reset commits
cd email_dashboard-be && pnpm build
cd ../email_dashboard-fe && npm run build
```

## Support & Maintenance

### Debug Logs
- Backend logs: `email_dashboard-be/logs/combined.log`
- Error logs: `email_dashboard-be/logs/error.log`
- Browser console: Check for frontend errors

### Common Issues

**Issue**: Settings page shows 401 error
**Solution**: Ensure cookie-parser middleware is running and cookies are enabled

**Issue**: Settings link visible to non-admin
**Solution**: Check user role in AuthContext, should be lowercase "admin"

**Issue**: Password reset fails
**Solution**: Check backend logs, ensure password meets minimum requirements
